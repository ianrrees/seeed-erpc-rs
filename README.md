An embedded / no-std implementation of Seeed Studio's eRPC protocol, which is used to communicate with
their RTL8720 firmware.

Most notably, this is the main firmware for the wifi chip in their [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html) product.

WIP - most RPCs are not yet implemented.
